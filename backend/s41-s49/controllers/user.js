	IMPORTANT NOTE
		- What happens in the user's browser when running the frontend code we've developed is beyond our control. The browser is a black box that, at some point, after the user has interacted with our code, might send us back a piece of data that our application cannot process. There is no guarantee that the data provided is what we need.
		- We can only validate the data coming from users to check if our backend recieved the information it is intended to receive.
		- We have done validations in the earlier stages of our API developtment.
		- That validation is the schema-level validation wherein we are checking if the data to be stored in our database is aligned with the properties of the models we have set for a collection/schema. e.g. User, Course, and Enrollment 
		-409 HTTP Status code refers to duplicate record which means that there is a duplicate document found in our database.
		- Usually, true/false response doesn't test the application response. However, for better communication to the client, it's better to send specific messages to validate wheter or not the data received needs correction.

		- The first digit of the status code defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any categorization role. There are five values for the first digit:
			-1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process.
			-2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.
			-3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
			-4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled 
			-5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request
		-HTTP response status codes indicate wheter or not a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed
		-For a get request, 200 code refers to successful request, meaning the server processed the request and returned a response back to the client without any errors.
		-500 http status refer to an internal server error which means that the request is valid, but an error occured in send the response. e.g. database issues, server-side codes, or server problems.

Important Note
	- With this, routes now simply handle the activation of the controller.
	- Controllers now handle all business logic.
	- The controllers now end the cycle as it is now expected to use res.send() and send a response.
	- next can be omitted from a middleware/controller if it will not pass the data to another function.
	- Controllers as middleware then make our code more readable and modular. Where you can simply add or remove controllers or middleware from a route.
